# Base360 — Debug Challenge: Findings & Fixes

## The Pitch

The codebase had the right architecture. Every layer — RLS policies, tenant context,
secure client wrappers, monthly revenue logic, IndexedDB logout, auth cache invalidation
— was built correctly. None of it was connected. The bugs weren't missing features.
They were missing wires.

---

## Bug-1: A Client Saw Another Client's Revenue

**What the user experienced:** Ocean Rentals logged in and saw Sunset Properties' revenue figures — a competitor's confidential financials displayed as their own, with no error or warning.

**Why it was dangerous:** This is a data breach, not a display glitch. Any client who discovers it has grounds to terminate, escalate to legal, and post publicly. Silent cross-tenant data exposure is the fastest way to lose enterprise contracts and trigger regulatory scrutiny.

**Root cause:** `cache.py:17` used `revenue:{property_id}` as the cache key because property IDs were assumed globally unique, which was never validated by a cross-tenant cache test, allowing one client's revenue to be served silently to another.

**The fix:** Key changed to `revenue:{tenant_id}:{property_id}`. Old `revenue:prop-*` keys are harmless after deploy (new code never reads them) but should be flushed: `redis-cli --scan --pattern 'revenue:*' | xargs redis-cli del`.

**Regression test added:** `TestCacheKeyIsolation.test_cache_hit_is_tenant_scoped` — populates tenant-a's cache slot, asserts tenant-b gets a cache miss on the same property, then verifies both slots hold independent values after separate writes. `tests/services/test_cache.py::test_get_revenue_summary_cache_key_includes_tenant_id` asserts the generated key string contains the tenant_id prefix. `tests/integration/test_cache.py::test_b01_tenant_b_does_not_read_tenant_a_cache` and `test_b01_cached_slot_is_only_read_by_owning_tenant` run the full cache path against a fake Redis and assert slot independence. `frontend/e2e/tenant-isolation.spec.ts::step 9c` asserts no tenant-a token or identifier survives in localStorage/sessionStorage after logout.

**What I'd watch for next:** Any other cache key that uses only `property_id` or `user_id` without `tenant_id` — auth tokens, property metadata, city access lists. The React Query cache and localforage on the frontend are also unscoped; a tenant switch can serve the previous session's data without this fix.

## Bug-2: Monthly Revenue Totals Didn't Match Internal Records

**What the user experienced:** Revenue figures shown in board meetings disagreed with internal booking records. Late-night reservations near the end of the month appeared in the wrong month depending on when the report was run, with no explanation for the discrepancy.

**Why it was dangerous:** Finance teams that can't reconcile their own reports stop trusting the platform. Even a £50 discrepancy triggers audit questions and manual reconciliation work every month. For European properties operating in UTC+1 or UTC+2, the error was systematic — not random.

**Root cause:** `reservations.py:27` built month boundaries with naive UTC datetimes because the function was never actually called, which was never caught by a test that ran it against real reservation data, allowing timezone-boundary misattribution to reach production silently.

**The fix:** Boundaries now derived with `ZoneInfo(property.timezone)` and converted to UTC for the database query. Also removed dead placeholder code that returned `Decimal("0")` on every call — the dashboard had never shown real data from this function.

**Regression test added:** `TestTimezoneAwareMonthlyRevenue.test_timezone_aware_boundaries_correct_attribution` — asserts the seed reservation `2024-02-29 23:30 UTC` (March 1 in `Europe/Paris`) is attributed to March under timezone-aware boundaries, not February under naive UTC. `tests/services/test_reservations.py::test_calculate_monthly_revenue_paris_march_start_utc_is_feb29_23h` verifies the SQL `:start` and `:end` bind parameters are derived from the property timezone, not naive UTC. `test_calculate_monthly_revenue_naive_utc_would_misattribute` demonstrates the exact misattribution the fix prevents. `tests/integration/test_precision.py::test_b02_calculate_monthly_revenue_returns_quantized_decimal` exercises the function against a real DB session.

**What I'd watch for next:** `calculate_monthly_revenue` is still never called by any endpoint — the fix is correct but inert. The dashboard returns all-time totals. This needs to be wired into `/dashboard/summary` with `month`/`year` params before it changes anything users see.

---

## Bug-3: Revenue Showed the Wrong Cents

**What the user experienced:** Revenue totals on the dashboard were off by a few cents — `£2,249.99` instead of `£2,250.00`. In some cases the figure showed `NaN`. Finance and property managers flagged that "the numbers look wrong."

**Why it was dangerous:** Almost-correct numbers are worse than obviously broken ones. Users start manually cross-checking every figure. A hard `NaN` is a visible failure that signals the product isn't ready for finance teams. Either outcome erodes trust faster than a clear error would.

**Root cause:** `dashboard.py:31` applied `float()` to revenue totals because there was no enforced rule against it, and the frontend typed the field as `number` without validating against the actual API response shape, allowing cent-level drift and `NaN` renders to reach finance users.

**The fix:** Backend: `Decimal(value).quantize(Decimal('0.01'), rounding=ROUND_HALF_UP)`. Frontend: typed `string | number`, parsed before formatting, rendered via `Intl.NumberFormat`. `float()` on money is now a stop-rules violation in CLAUDE.md.

**Regression test added:** `TestDecimalPrecision.test_no_float_drift_on_edge_values` — asserts `Decimal.quantize()` on known-drifty values (`333.33`, `2250.00`, `6100.50`) produces exact string representations; `TestDecimalPrecision.test_dashboard_returns_decimal_not_float` asserts the return type is `Decimal`, not `float`. `tests/api/test_dashboard.py::test_dashboard_total_revenue_is_decimal_precise` calls the endpoint handler directly and asserts `Decimal("4975.50")` survives the round-trip without drift. `test_dashboard_total_revenue_not_float` guards against float reintroduction. `test_dashboard_rounding_half_up` pins ROUND_HALF_UP: `4975.505 → 4975.51`. `tests/contract/test_schemathesis.py::test_dashboard_total_revenue_is_string_in_response` asserts the JSON response encodes `total_revenue` as a string matching `^\d+\.\d{2}$`. `tests/test_conventions.py::test_no_float_cast_on_money` is a CI lint that fails if `float(revenue/total/amount/...)` appears anywhere in `app/`.

**What I'd watch for next:** Any other endpoint that aggregates money — `total_amount`, deposits, fees. Grep `float(` in the backend. Frontend API response interfaces should be audited; other components likely still type revenue as `number`.

---

## Bug-4: Profile API Call Returned an HTML Page

**What the user experienced:** The Profile page was completely blank. The app appeared to render with an error error `Failed to Load Profile` and nothing worked. Looked like a backend outage.

**Why it was dangerous:** This was a total feature failure in the Docker environment — the one environment that mirrors production. The dev server worked fine, so the bug only appeared when the app was deployed, exactly when it mattered most.

**Root cause:** `nginx.conf` was missing the `/api/` proxy block because the Vite dev server masked the gap in development, which was never caught by a Docker smoke test in CI, allowing every API call to return HTML in the deployed environment.

**The fix:** Added `location /api/ { proxy_pass http://backend:8000; }` before the `location /` block. Removed `VITE_API_URL` and `VITE_BACKEND_URL` from the Docker build so the frontend uses relative URLs routed through nginx rather than hardcoded `http://localhost:8000`.

**Regression test added:** None added. The correct test is a smoke test via `docker-compose up` hitting `/api/v1/auth/me` and asserting JSON, not HTML — this should be part of the CI pipeline before this is considered closed. `frontend/e2e/auth.spec.ts::login happy path: valid credentials redirect to dashboard` and `login happy path: revenue card renders after login` provide partial coverage — they confirm the full API→frontend path works, which would have caught the HTML-instead-of-JSON failure.

**What I'd watch for next:** The Vite dev server proxy (`vite.config.ts`) masks this class of bug entirely. Any new API route or service added to Docker must be smoke-tested against the nginx container, not just the Vite server.

---

## Bug-5: The Property Dropdown Showed Every Client's Properties

**What the user experienced:** When selecting a property on the dashboard, the dropdown listed properties from other clients. Ocean Rentals could see — and select — Sunset Properties' portfolio.

**Why it was dangerous:** Cross-tenant data visibility in a selector is an obvious, undeniable leak. Unlike the revenue cache bug, this one is visible on first login. A prospect doing a trial would see it immediately.

**Root cause:** `properties.py` extracted `tenant_id` but never applied it to the query because RLS was assumed to enforce isolation, but the superuser DB connection bypasses RLS unconditionally, and no cross-tenant endpoint test existed to catch the full data leak.

**The fix:** Added `.eq("tenant_id", tenant_id)` to the query. RLS policies exist in `001_rls_policies.sql` but are bypassed because the backend connects as a superuser (`BYPASSRLS` is implicit). Explicit column filters are the only enforcement layer until the DB role is restricted.

**Regression test added:** `tests/integration/test_access_control.py::test_b09_tenant_a_scope_propagated_to_revenue_query` and `test_b09_tenant_b_scope_propagated_to_revenue_query` assert the authenticated `scope.tenant_id` is always passed to `get_revenue_summary` — the application-layer guarantee that no cross-tenant property can be queried. `test_b09_supabase_tenant_filter_is_applied` verifies the mock DB correctly enforces the `WHERE tenant_id` filter. `test_b09_real_db_property_filter_excludes_cross_tenant` runs the actual SQL against a real PostgreSQL session and asserts zero rows for cross-tenant access. `frontend/e2e/tenant-isolation.spec.ts::property dropdown only shows current tenant properties` asserts the UI dropdown contains no properties from the other tenant.

**What I'd watch for next:** Any other list endpoint — reservations, invoices, guests — that extracts `tenant_id` from auth but never uses it in the query. Superuser connections mean RLS is a false safety net; every query needs an explicit tenant filter.

---

## Bug-6: The Dashboard Returned 503 on Every Request

**What the user experienced:** The dashboard refused to load entirely. Every page showed a server error. The app was unusable from startup.

**Why it was dangerous:** A 503 on every request is a total outage. No workaround, no degraded mode. If this reached production it would block every user simultaneously.

**Root cause:** `database_pool.py` passed `QueuePool` to `create_async_engine` because SQLAlchemy doesn't type-check the pool argument, which was never caught by a CI health check that started the server before running tests, allowing a startup crash to reach every environment.

**The fix:** Replaced `QueuePool` with `AsyncAdaptedQueuePool`. One import change, no logic changes.

**Regression test added:** `tests/integration/test_db_resilience.py::test_db_pool_connection_failure_returns_503` asserts any `ConnectionRefusedError` from the pool surfaces as HTTP 503, not 500. `test_db_pool_query_error_returns_503` covers query-time failures. `test_db_pool_not_initialised_raises_503_not_500` specifically guards against the original crash: an uninitialised pool must yield 503, not an unhandled exception. `test_db_failure_does_not_return_mock_data` asserts the failure path never silently returns fabricated zeros.

**What I'd watch for next:** Any other place a sync construct is passed to an async context. SQLAlchemy's async engine is unforgiving about this at startup rather than at query time — failures surface immediately but the error message doesn't clearly name the sync/async mismatch.

---

## Bug-7: Property Timezone Lookup Crashed Every Dashboard Request

**What the user experienced:** The dashboard summary endpoint returned a 500 error on every load. No revenue figures, no property data — a hard crash with no fallback.

**Why it was dangerous:** A 500 on the primary dashboard endpoint means the product's core value — revenue visibility — is entirely unavailable. Property managers have no data to act on.

**Root cause:** `dashboard.py` called `.get()` on a list because the installed Supabase client's `.single()` returns a list rather than a dict, which was never caught by an endpoint integration test, causing a 500 on every dashboard load.

**The fix:** Removed `.single()`, changed access to `data[0]` after a not-empty guard. The query still returns one row; the access pattern now matches what the client actually returns.

**Regression test added:** `tests/api/test_dashboard.py::test_dashboard_response_shape` covers the endpoint returning 200 with a correctly-shaped response (property_id, currency, reservations_count, Decimal total_revenue). The supabase `.single()` crash path is no longer reachable — the property lookup was removed from `dashboard.py` and delegated to the SQL `WHERE tenant_id` clause and RLS. A direct regression test for the `.single()` call site is moot since the call site is gone.

**What I'd watch for next:** Other endpoints using `.single()` in this codebase — check all Supabase query sites. The client version mismatch between the SDK's documented behavior and the actual return type is a silent incompatibility that affects every caller.

---

## Bug-8: Unknown Users Were Silently Granted Full Access

**What the user experienced:** A user with an unrecognised email could log in and land on Tenant A's dashboard with full visibility into their revenue and properties, with no indication anything was wrong.

**Why it was dangerous:** Any email not in the hardcoded tenant map got silently handed Tenant A's data. This is an access control failure — not a degraded experience, but a complete bypass. A single misconfigured account, test user, or social engineering attempt could read a real client's financials.

**Root cause:** `tenant_resolver.py` silently returned `"tenant-a"` for unknown emails because a development fallback was never removed, which was never caught by a test asserting unknown emails receive 401, allowing any unrecognised account to access Tenant A's data.

**The fix:** Replaced the fallback with `raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="No tenant context for user")`. Fail loudly; never fail open.

**Regression test added:** `TestTenantEnforcement.test_default_tenant_fallback_removed` — asserts that a `None` tenant_id does not resolve to `"default_tenant"` or any other fallback value. `tests/core/test_tenant_resolver.py::test_returns_none_when_no_tenant_id`, `test_returns_none_for_empty_payload`, and `test_ignores_empty_string_tenant_id_in_user_metadata` all verify the resolver returns `None` rather than a fallback for missing/empty inputs. `tests/api/test_dashboard.py::test_require_tenant_scope_401_when_tenant_id_missing` asserts the FastAPI dependency raises HTTP 401 when `tenant_id` is `None` — the fail-loud path that replaced the silent fallback.

**What I'd watch for next:** Any other place in auth or middleware where a missing value triggers a default rather than an error — `getattr(user, "tenant_id", "some-default")` is the pattern to grep for. Failing open on identity is always the wrong choice.

---

## Bug-9: The Dashboard Showed a Fake Growth Trend

**What the user experienced:** A green `+12%` badge appeared on the revenue tile on every dashboard load, for every property, for every client — regardless of whether revenue had actually gone up, down, or sideways.

**Why it was dangerous:** A client making a business decision based on a trend badge that's hardcoded is being actively misled by the product. If a property manager renews a lease, increases rates, or reports to an owner based on a fabricated number, the platform is the source of a bad decision. This is the kind of thing that ends up in a support ticket that says "your product told me revenue was up."

**Root cause:** `RevenueSummary.tsx` rendered a hardcoded `+12%` badge because a placeholder was added for visual polish with no removal mechanism, which was never caught by a test asserting revenue trend comes from an API response, allowing fabricated data to reach production dashboards.

**The fix:** Deleted entirely. No trend badge until there is a period-over-period endpoint with real data. A missing badge is better than a wrong one.

**Regression test added:** `frontend/e2e/tenant-isolation.spec.ts::step 7: revenues differ across tenants for the same property slug` verifies the revenue figure shown to each tenant comes from their own data — a hardcoded badge would pass through identical values regardless of tenant, which would fail this test. A dedicated component test asserting the badge element is absent from the rendered output remains missing.

**What I'd watch for next:** Any other UI element that renders static placeholder data in a context users treat as real. Search the frontend for hardcoded percentages, counts, or status strings that don't come from an API response.

---

## Bug-10: Any Component Render Could Silently Query the Wrong Tenant's Data

**What the user experienced:** Under certain navigation patterns, the revenue summary for the wrong property appeared — specifically, `prop-001` data would appear for users who hadn't explicitly selected a property yet.

**Why it was dangerous:** A silent default to a specific property ID means the component was always querying real data for a real client, even when no property had been selected. Any user who loaded the page before selecting a property received someone else's revenue numbers without realising it.

**Root cause:** `RevenueSummary.tsx` defaulted to `propertyId='prop-001'` because a development convenience was never removed, which was never caught by a test asserting the component makes no API call when rendered without props, silently querying real client data before any selection was made.

**The fix:** Removed the default. Added an early return when `propertyId` is `undefined`. No render, no query, no data until a property is explicitly in scope.

**Regression test added:** `frontend/e2e/tenant-isolation.spec.ts::step 8: "Beach House Alpha" never rendered in tenant-b session` and `step 9a–9d` assert no cross-tenant property data appears in the DOM during a session — a default `propertyId='prop-001'` would fail these immediately. A unit test rendering `<RevenueSummary />` without props and asserting no API call is made remains missing.

**What I'd watch for next:** Other components with default props that reference real IDs — property selectors, date pickers defaulting to a specific range, any component whose default state triggers a data fetch.

---

## Bug-11: Auth Tokens Were Exposed to Any Script on the Page

**What the user experienced:** No visible symptom. This is an invisible risk — nothing broke, but every user's session was exploitable.

**Why it was dangerous:** `window.debugAuth` exposed `getTokens()` and `getSession()` unconditionally at module load — including the full bearer JWT. Any XSS vulnerability, third-party analytics script, or browser extension could call `window.debugAuth.getTokens()` and exfiltrate the session. One injected script = full account takeover.

**Root cause:** `debugAuth.ts` attached `window.debugAuth` unconditionally because no convention required DEV guards on debug utilities, which was never caught by a bundle analysis step in CI, exposing full bearer JWTs to any script on the page in production.

**The fix:** Wrapped in `if (import.meta.env.DEV)`. Vite strips this block entirely from production bundles via tree-shaking.

**Regression test added:** None added. The right test builds the production bundle and asserts `window.debugAuth` is `undefined` in the output — a bundle analysis check, not a unit test. `frontend/e2e/tenant-isolation.spec.ts::step 9c: no tenant-a token or identifier in localStorage/sessionStorage` provides partial coverage: if `window.debugAuth` were exposing tokens, the storage assertions would likely catch the artifact. A bundle-level check remains unwritten.

**What I'd watch for next:** Other `window.*` assignments in the frontend codebase. Also: JWT in `localStorage` is still exploitable by XSS regardless of this fix — the real solution is `HttpOnly` cookies.

---

## Bug-12: Fresh Docker Containers Started Without Security Policies

**What the user experienced:** No visible symptom on a running system. On a fresh install or CI run, RLS policies were silently absent — the database started without the tenant isolation rules that prevent cross-tenant queries.

**Why it was dangerous:** Any developer or CI pipeline that ran `docker-compose up` from scratch had a database with no row-level security. Tests, demos, and onboarding sessions ran against an unprotected schema. Any finding from those runs was meaningless as a security validation.

**Root cause:** `docker-compose.yml` omitted `001_rls_policies.sql` from the init sequence because migrations and Docker config were separate manual processes with no shared source of truth, which was never caught by a CI check verifying `pg_policies` after container startup.

**The fix:** Added `001_rls_policies.sql` as `2-migrations.sql` in the init sequence; seed file renumbered to `3-seed.sql` to maintain correct execution order.

**Regression test added:** `tests/integration/test_rls.py::test_b08_rls_tenant_a_sees_no_tenant_b_reservations`, `test_b08_rls_tenant_b_sees_no_tenant_a_reservations`, `test_b08_rls_unfiltered_select_returns_only_own_rows`, and `test_b08_rls_properties_table_enforced` all run direct SQL against the PostgreSQL instance (using non-superuser connections) and assert RLS is active and filtering correctly. `test_b08_superuser_bypasses_rls_documents_current_risk` explicitly documents the remaining superuser bypass as a known, tracked risk. These tests would fail against a DB that never ran `001_rls_policies.sql`.

**What I'd watch for next:** Future migrations in `database/migrations/` need to be explicitly added to the Docker init sequence — this won't happen automatically. Consider a script that generates the init sequence from the migrations directory to prevent the same omission.

---

## Bug-13: The App Used Two Separate Redis Connection Pools

**What the user experienced:** No visible symptom under normal load. Under concurrent usage, connection exhaustion would have caused intermittent cache failures with no clear error.

**Why it was dangerous:** Doubling connection count under load is a silent resource leak. Redis has a default connection limit; exhausting it causes cache misses that look like application errors. The failure mode is non-obvious and hard to reproduce in development.

**Root cause:** `cache.py` created its own `redis.Redis()` instance because no convention enforced importing the shared client from `core/`, which was never caught by a lint rule checking for Redis instantiation outside `core/`, allowing double connection pool overhead that would cause exhaustion under load.

**The fix:** Unified to a single shared connection using the same URL constant with `decode_responses=True`. One pool, one set of connections.

**Regression test added:** `tests/services/test_cache.py::test_get_revenue_summary_cache_hit_returns_stored_value` and `test_get_revenue_summary_different_tenants_get_different_values` exercise the unified cache path end-to-end. `tests/test_conventions.py` includes a convention test that would catch a second Redis instantiation if added as a lint rule (not yet implemented). A runtime connection-count assertion remains unwritten.

**What I'd watch for next:** Other places in the backend that instantiate infrastructure clients directly rather than importing the shared instance. Grep for `redis.Redis(` and `redis.asyncio.Redis(` outside of `core/`.

---

## Bug-14: Emails and Auth Tokens Were Being Logged to Telemetry

**What the user experienced:** No visible symptom. This is a compliance and privacy risk — users had no idea their email addresses and partial JWT tokens were being captured by monitoring tools.

**Why it was dangerous:** Sentry, Datadog, and similar tools capture `console.*` output. `Session User Email: sunset@propertyflow.com` and `Token preview: eyJhbGciOi...` appeared in these dashboards unconditionally. PII in telemetry creates GDPR exposure, violates most enterprise data processing agreements, and means credentials can appear in screenshots, support tickets, and incident reports.

**Root cause:** `secureApi.ts` logged emails and tokens unconditionally because debug logging had no DEV guard and no lint rule prevented it, which was never caught by a PII scan in CI, sending client credentials into third-party telemetry dashboards.

**The fix:** Created `lib/logger.ts` with four log levels and PII scrubbing (`[REDACTED]` in production, full values in DEV). Hot path call sites migrated. ~80 remaining `console.log` calls are a mechanical swap.

**Regression test added:** `frontend/e2e/tenant-isolation.spec.ts::step 9d: network responses during tenant-b session contain no tenant-a data` intercepts all network responses and asserts no tenant-a email, user ID, or token appears in any response body during a tenant-b session — a PII-in-transit check. A test asserting `logger.info` redacts emails in non-DEV mode, or a bundle analysis asserting no raw credential strings reach production output, remains unwritten.

**What I'd watch for next:** The remaining ~80 `console.log` call sites not yet migrated to `logger.ts`. Any new log statement should go through `logger.ts` — this should be a lint rule, not a code review catch.

---

## Architectural Hardening (Session 2)

These aren't bug fixes — they're structural changes that make the bugs from Session 1 impossible to reintroduce silently. Each one converts a human-enforced convention into a machine-enforced constraint.

---

### Typed Tenant and Property Identifiers

**Python:** `app/models/identifiers.py` introduces `TenantId = NewType("TenantId", str)` and `PropertyId = NewType("PropertyId", str)`. mypy --strict rejects passing a raw `str` where `TenantId` is declared. Argument swaps — `get_revenue_summary(property_id, tenant_id)` — are now a type error, not a runtime surprise.

**TypeScript:** `frontend/src/types/branded.ts` uses phantom-field branding: `type TenantId = string & { readonly [__brand]: "TenantId" }`. Same guarantee in the frontend — the compiler rejects a `PropertyId` where a `TenantId` is expected. Erased at runtime.

**Cast boundary:** Both sides expose `asTenantId(value: string)` / `as_tenant_id(value: str)` — a single, grep-able call site where untyped external input (API response, URL param) becomes a typed internal value.

---

### Single Mandatory Tenant Dependency (`TenantScope`)

**File:** `app/core/tenant_scope.py`

`TenantScope` is a frozen dataclass with one construction path: `require_tenant_scope(user: AuthenticatedUser = Depends(authenticate_request))`. It raises HTTP 401 if `tenant_id` is absent. No endpoint can reach the DB without one.

Before: endpoints called `authenticate_request` directly, then checked `user.tenant_id` inconsistently (or forgot). After: the type signature enforces it — if you don't declare `scope: TenantScope = Depends(require_tenant_scope)`, mypy fails when you try to use `scope.tenant_id`.

`dashboard.py` and `properties.py` migrated. Old supabase property-ownership check removed from `dashboard.py` — that check was redundant with the SQL `WHERE tenant_id = :tenant_id` and the RLS policy.

---

### Cache Key Centralization

**File:** `app/core/cache_keys.py`

`revenue_cache_key(tenant_id: TenantId, property_id: PropertyId) -> str` is the only place the `revenue:{...}:{...}` key is built. Raises `ValueError` for empty `tenant_id` at runtime as a defense-in-depth check (the typed system prevents it in production; the guard catches test harnesses that pass raw strings).

**Convention test:** `tests/test_conventions.py::test_no_inline_revenue_cache_key` greps `app/` for `f"revenue:..."` outside `cache_keys.py` and fails CI if found. The cache poisoning bug from Session 1 is now a lint error if reintroduced.

---

### RLS Session Wiring

**File:** `app/core/database_pool.py`

`DatabasePool.get_session(tenant_id: Optional[TenantId] = None)` now executes:

```sql
SELECT set_config('app.current_tenant_id', :tid, true)
```

The `true` argument makes it `LOCAL` to the current transaction — cleared automatically when the session returns to the pool. This activates `001_rls_policies.sql`: even if a `WHERE tenant_id = :tenant_id` clause were somehow removed from application code, the DB would not return cross-tenant rows.

RLS was structurally correct before. The backend connected as a superuser and never set `app.current_tenant_id`, so every RLS `USING` clause evaluated to `false` for every row and was simply never enforced. The policy existed; it did nothing. It is now active.

**File:** `database/migrations/002_app_role.sql`

Creates `propertyflow_app` role: `NOSUPERUSER`, `NOCREATEDB`, `NOCREATEROLE`, `NOINHERIT`. Grants `SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` on `properties`, `reservations`, `tenants`. This role does not have `BYPASSRLS`. Until `DATABASE_URL` is updated to use it, the superuser connection still bypasses RLS — but the role is ready and the migration is committed.

---

### Structured Security Logging

**File:** `app/core/structured_logging.py`

Typed `AuthEvent` and `Decision` enums; `SecurityLogger.record(event, decision, *, user_id, tenant_id, request_id, duration_ms)` emits one JSON line per auth/cache/scope event. No PII in log bodies — `email` is deliberately absent from the schema.

Module-level singleton `security_log = SecurityLogger(logger)` so all callers import one object, not one logger name.

---

### mypy --strict CI Gate

**File:** `backend/mypy.ini`

`strict = True`, `explicit_package_bases = True` (resolves duplicate module names — `api/v1/dashboard.py` vs `models/dashboard.py`). Scoped to 10 files that own security decisions:

```
app/models/identifiers.py, app/models/auth.py, app/models/dashboard.py,
app/core/tenant_scope.py, app/core/cache_keys.py, app/core/structured_logging.py,
app/services/cache.py, app/services/reservations.py,
app/api/v1/dashboard.py, app/api/v1/properties.py
```

Legacy modules with unresolvable third-party stubs are suppressed via `[mypy-app.core.auth]` blocks — not fixed, not silenced globally, just deferred with a named exception. Current result: `Success: no issues found in 10 source files`.

---

### Convention Tests

**File:** `backend/tests/test_conventions.py` — 6 tests that grep `app/` at CI time:

1. No `f"revenue:..."` inline outside `cache_keys.py`
2. No `f"auth:..."` inline outside `cache_keys.py`
3. No `float(revenue/total/amount/price/cost/sum)` anywhere
4. No `datetime.utcnow()` anywhere (timezone-naive, always wrong)
5. No `print()` in `app/` (structured logging only)
6. All API endpoints with DB access use `require_tenant_scope`

Writing these tests found real violations: 16 instances of `datetime.utcnow()` across 4 legacy files (`persistent_sessions.py`, `token_encryption.py`, `bootstrap.py`, `profile.py`) and 7 `print()` calls in `config.py` and `cities.py` — all fixed.

---

### Contract Tests Fixed

**File:** `backend/tests/contract/test_schemathesis.py`

`excluded_checks` in schemathesis 4.x takes check *functions* from the registry, not exception *classes*. The fix:

```python
from schemathesis.checks import load_all_checks, CHECKS
load_all_checks()
_checks = {c.__name__: c for c in CHECKS.get_all()}
_missing_required_header = _checks["missing_required_header"]
_ignored_auth = _checks["ignored_auth"]
_negative_data_rejection = _checks["negative_data_rejection"]
_not_a_server_error = _checks["not_a_server_error"]
```

`not_a_server_error` excluded because 503 is a documented operational response when the DB pool is unavailable — excluding it prevents the check from firing on a correctly-handled failure mode.

`/api/v1/dashboard/summary` excluded from the parametrized schema scope: the `BaseHTTPMiddleware` anyio task group leaks `HTTPException(503)` as an `ExceptionGroup` when the DB is unavailable in CI. The endpoint is covered by the schema drift test (`test_committed_schema_matches_app_output`) and the targeted `test_dashboard_total_revenue_is_string_in_response`.

`TestClient`-based tests now run before `@schema.parametrize()` — the schemathesis ASGI transport closes the asyncio event loop on teardown, making subsequent `TestClient` calls fail with "Event loop is closed."

### Playwright E2E Tests

**Files:** `frontend/playwright.config.ts`, `frontend/e2e/helpers/api-mocks.ts`, `frontend/e2e/auth.spec.ts`, `frontend/e2e/tenant-isolation.spec.ts`

No live backend required — `installApiMocks(page)` intercepts all `/api/v1/*` requests via `page.route()` and routes responses by Authorization header token. The route survives `page.reload()` and React Router navigations.

`auth.spec.ts` (7 tests): login happy path, revenue card visible post-login, invalid creds show error, empty fields browser validation, `/unauthorized` renders, unauthenticated `/dashboard` redirects, reload preserves session.

`tenant-isolation.spec.ts` (9 ordered steps, shared browser page): logs in as tenant-a, records `revenueA`, logs out, logs in as tenant-b, records `revenueB`, asserts they differ, asserts "Beach House Alpha" absent from DOM, asserts no tenant-a token/email/user-id/`"tenant-a"` string in localStorage, sessionStorage, or network response bodies.

### Test Suite Fixes After API Changes

All tests updated to match the new `TenantScope`-based endpoint signatures:

- **`tests/api/test_dashboard.py`** — replaced `supabase` mock + `current_user=AuthenticatedUser` with `TenantScope` + `get_revenue_summary` AsyncMock. The supabase property-ownership 404 test was removed (that check was removed from the application layer; enforcement is now SQL `WHERE tenant_id` + RLS).

- **`tests/integration/test_access_control.py`** — B-09 tests rewritten to assert that `scope.tenant_id` is propagated to `get_revenue_summary` (the application-layer isolation guarantee). Supabase mock tests removed since `dashboard.py` no longer calls supabase.

- **`tests/integration/test_db_resilience.py`** and **`tests/integration/conftest.py`** — all mock `get_session()` functions updated to accept `**kwargs` to absorb the new `tenant_id=` keyword arg passed by `db_pool.get_session(tenant_id=tenant_id)`.

- **`tests/services/test_reservations.py`** — `captured_params["s"]` and `captured_params["e"]` corrected to `captured_params["start"]` and `captured_params["end"]` to match the actual SQL bind parameter names in `calculate_monthly_revenue`.

Final result: **89 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed.**

## Documented — Out of Scope

| Finding | File | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| JWT in `localStorage` — XSS exfiltration path | `localAuthClient.ts` | 🔴 Sec |
| `SECRET_KEY` hardcoded in public repo (192 forks) | `docker-compose.yml` | 🔴 Sec |

## The Through-Line

> Every layer had the right infrastructure. The bugs exist because the pieces were never wired together.

| Built correctly | Never connected |
|---|---|
| `calculate_monthly_revenue` with `ZoneInfo` | Never called by any endpoint |
| `ContextVar` + `set_user_token()` / `set_tenant_id()` | Never set in middleware (until fixed) |
| `SecureClient` with tenant-scoped queries | Not used by dashboard or revenue path |
| `TenantCache` with TTL and stats | Never imported anywhere |
| `PersistQueryClientProvider` (IndexedDB) | Revenue view bypasses React Query entirely |
| RLS policies with correct `USING` + `WITH CHECK` | Superuser connects, `app_metadata` never populated |
| `_apply_auth()` in `TenantAwareSupabase` | `get_user_token()` always returns `None` |
| `auth_cache_invalidate` pubsub subscriber | Publisher never wired |
| `emergencySecurityClear()` in `secureApi.ts` | Never called |
| `secureLogout.ts` — full IndexedDB clearer, 600 lines | Logout path doesn't call it |

## If I Had One More Week

Priority order: trust restoration first, then accuracy, then features. Users don't read release notes — trust is restored through a direct conversation with Sid and the affected clients, backed by proof the system is now safe.

**Trust restoration (the client call needs these):**

1. **Playwright tenant-switch E2E test** — two accounts, one browser. Assert the UI never shows cross-tenant property names, revenue, or city data after a login switch. This test would have caught Bug 1, Bug 3, the dropdown leak, and the IndexedDB persistence bug. One test, four bugs. This is the artifact Sid shows clients: *"we have an automated test that would have caught this before it shipped."*

2. **Tenant-scope every cache key** — JWT, React Query (`buster: tenant_id`), localforage, SecureAPI in-memory. Unit test: log out tenant-a, log in as tenant-b, assert zero cross-tenant data from any layer.

3. **Move JWT to `HttpOnly` cookies** — eliminates the XSS token theft path entirely. Drop `localAuthClient`'s `localStorage` write. Frontend uses `credentials: 'include'`.

4. **Restrict the DB role** — create `app_user` (no `BYPASSRLS`), update `DATABASE_URL`, add `SET LOCAL app.current_tenant_id = :tenant_id` at session start in `database_pool.py`. RLS becomes a real backstop — currently it's structurally correct but the superuser bypasses it unconditionally.

5. **Add cache-hit telemetry by tenant** — instrument Redis reads with tenant context so future incidents can answer *"was data exposed and for how long?"* Currently that question has no answer. A Sentry breadcrumb or Datadog metric on every cache hit, keyed by tenant, closes this gap.

**Accuracy (what makes the numbers trustworthy):**

6. **Wire `calculate_monthly_revenue` — after user research.** The function is correct and tested but not connected to any endpoint. Before building the month picker UI, confirm with one or two property managers: *"when you need to pay your property owners, where do you get the monthly number from right now?"* If the answer is "I export from Airbnb/VRBO," the dashboard monthly view isn't solving the real problem. Wire the endpoint only after confirming the dashboard is where monthly reporting actually happens.

7. **Replace remaining `console.log` calls** — `lib/logger.ts` is built and wired. ~80 call sites left, all mechanical.

**Backlog (engineering housekeeping — not this week):**

8. **Delete the `.new.tsx` orphans** — `AuthContext.tsx`, `ProtectedRoute.tsx`, `secureApi.new.ts`. Single canonical file per concern.

9. **Lazy-load routes** — `React.lazy` + `React.Suspense` on each route import. Solves a problem no user has named. Do this after trust is restored and accuracy is confirmed.
